start from ACVER 0.1:
	1. use JWT standard SDK to verify and unload the token
	2. check JWT header to recognize if this is JWTEA token
	3. based on version in header, verify and load the JWT payload and get necessary data
	4. save Client RSA and algo data. return a JAVA instance and can receive the siged payload and signature to verify
		the RSA pub has a getter
		user may have own logic to sign data. So the SDK will only get key and give a method to help verify the signature
		after JWT verify passed, user can verify Client RSA signature themselves and pass or reject the request by their own logic
	5. if verify passed, user can read all field in payload and header as a map. "P-JWTEA-" prefix field can be excluded or not
